# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration
Overview:

This project aims to extract, process, and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The repository contains a wealth of metrics and statistics, which we will transform into valuable insights displayed through an interactive dashboard. The key steps include data extraction, transformation, insertion into a MySQL database, and finally, dashboard creation using Streamlit and Plotly in Python.

Problem Statement:

The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository holds extensive data that requires extraction and processing to derive meaningful insights. The solution entails:

Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the GitHub repository and fetch the data.
Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas for cleaning and formatting.
Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in MySQL for efficient retrieval. 
Dashboard Creation: Utilizing Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive visualization tool.
Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the MySQL database to dynamically update the dashboard.
Deployment: Ensuring security, efficiency, and user-friendliness of the solution. 
Approach Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the GitHub repository and store data in CSV or JSON format. 
Data Transformation: Python and Pandas for cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting data. 
Database Insertion: Using mysql-connector-python to connect and insert data into MySQL. 
Dashboard Creation: Streamlit and Plotly for an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
Data Retrieval: mysql-connector-python to fetch data into Pandas dataframe for dynamic updates. 
Deployment: Thorough testing and public deployment for accessibility.

Results:

The project delivers a live geo visualization dashboard with a variety of dropdown options for users. It dynamically updates to reflect the latest data from the MySQL database. Users can access it via web browsers, obtaining valuable insights from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.


Learning Outcomes:

Data Extraction and Processing: Clone GitHub, preprocess data with Pandas. Database Management: Utilize MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. Visualization and Dashboard Creation: Create interactive dashboards with Streamlit and Plotly. Geo Visualization: Display data on maps using Plotly. Dynamic Updating: Develop dashboards that update based on database changes. Project Development and Deployment: Comprehensive solution development, testing, and deployment.

Inspiration:

This project draws inspiration from PhonePe Pulse.
